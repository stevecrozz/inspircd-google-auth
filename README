inspircd-google-auth is an inspIRCd module. When enabled it handles
authentication using a https Google API call.

I have never written anything in C++ so if something looks ugly, it probably
is. I'd love to hear feedback on how to improve this module.

First, add the module to your inspIRCd source under src/modules, compile and
install.

Next, add these lines to your configuration to enable the module.

<module name="m_googleauth.so">
<googleauth
  domainrestriction="yourdomain.com"
  killreason="Access denied.">
